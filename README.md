# Retro Remaster - Handout

### Points
80

---

### Due Date
09/27/2024

---

### Goal
To showcase your use of the fundamental Game Engine skills by creating a remaster of an arcade game in Unity.

---

### Instructions
1. Create a Fork of this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top-right of this page. Set the Repository Name to be 'LastNameFirstInitial-Retro-Remaster' (without the quotes). For example, mine would be 'HerreraSturmD-Retro-Remaster' (without the quotes). Click 'Create Fork'

2. Use your preferred GitHub client (SourceTree, Bash, etc.) to clone your fork of the repository into your student folder under 'E:\VGD\YOUR_STUDENT_NUMBER'.

3. Open the project's Unity folder using Unity 2022.1.22f1. You can now begin creating your game.

4. We will have several lessons in class during the duration of the project, each going over different Game Engine skills. You must create a remaster of an arcade game in Unity using those skills. The way you implement it is up to you, but each skill must be present. For example, one day, we may learn how to manipulate velocity and you would implement that into your game in some way, such as making the player move when a button is pressed, adding a jump, etc. Another day, we may learn how to change the animation that's playing and you would implement that by adding enemy animations, animating tiles in your level, making an animated title screen, etc. If you have trouble getting started, there are some examples that you can base yours off of.

5. Every day, before you leave class, stage, commit, and push to GitHub. This will allow you to work from home if you want. If you decide to do that, don't forget to also stage, commit, and push anytime you finish working at home.

### Evaluation Procedure
1. Anytime you're evaluated for a skill, you can score anywhere from a 0 to a 4 on that skill. If you score less than a 'Proficient' (3), then you need to continue working on the skill before you start the next project. Your grade for the project is never set in stone and can move up once you feel like you've improved in any given skill, you just need to be re-evaluated. The only deadlines in which a grade can't be improved are at the end of each quarter. The 5 different levels that you can score for each skill are:
    - No Attempt (0): The skill was not used or attempted in any way in your project.
    - Introductory (1): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Developing (2): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Proficiency (3): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Advanced (4): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.

2. Your total grade on the project will be based on all the individual skill grades that were recorded, added together and adjusted to be worth the number of points that the project is worth (aka, each skill will be worth an equal part of your grade relative to the number of skills assessed and how many points the project is worth). For example, if a project is worth 80 points and there are 10 skills, then each skill is worth 8 points. For that skill, you will receive a percentage of 8 points based on whether you got a 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the scale explained above. For example, if you got a 1, you'd get 2 points for that skill (since 1/4 of 8 is 2). This will be added together to determine your total grade for the project.

3. You'll be given multiple opportunities to correct your work until submission and you can always re-submit past the due date for a better grade with no penalty. Late penalties in general are not applied to assignments. Instead, your professionalism grade might take a hit for late submissions. This only applies if the initial submission is late, not any following submissions to improve your work. Sometimes, there are accentuating circumstances and if you let me know in advance, I will most likely be reasonable regarding lifting penalties unless you are just procrastinating on doing work.

4. Your grade for the project will be rounded to the nearest whole number. Your grade in the gradebook will be a reflection of whatever your most recent evaluation scored as long as each skill was at a 'Proficient' or higher.

### How to Submit
Create a Pull Request on GitHub and have a 2nd-Year student approve it up to the day before the project is due. The 2nd-Year will only approve it if you've reached at least 'Proficient' on each skill. You can make multiple pull requests before the project is due, so don't wait until the last minute! Once your request is approved, your project will be submitted and you will be ready for your evaluation with the instructor. Again, you can always resubmit by creating a new pull request.

---

### Success Criteria
I am successful once I have shown mastery in each skill by scoring at least a 'Proficient' on each one during my evaluation with my instructor.
